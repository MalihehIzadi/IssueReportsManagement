# Issue Reports Management
This repository contains our source code ad data on the use of machine learning methods to automatically detect the objective and priority-level of issue reports in software repositories.

It currently contains the following two parts:
<ul>
  <li><p><code>Objective Detection</code>: This directory contains our scripts on state-of-the-art ML algorithms to automatically identify the goal behind opeining an issue and categorziing them into three groups of bug reports, enhancement requests, and finally support</p></li>
  <li><p><code>Priority Prediction</code>: This directory contains our scripts on ML models for prediciting the priority of an issue report for task assigneent or maintenance purposes..</p></li>
</ul>
